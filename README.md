## Setup

1. Clone the repo

```
❯ git clone git@github.com:philihp/ddr.git
```

2. Ensure you have Node installed. You'll want the version in .tool-versions, which will be automatically selected if you use [asdf](https://gist.github.com/philihp/7453e9051663a52f442ed6a7afdddd61)... using other versions should work too, probably.

```
❯ node -v
v14.4.0
```

3. Go into the folder and install dependencies

```
❯ cd ddr
❯ npm install
```

4. Now run the development server.

```bash
❯ npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
